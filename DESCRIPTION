Description: Implements an estimation method for Hawkes processes when count data are only observed in discrete time, using a spectral approach derived from the Bartlett spectrum, see Cheysson and Lang (2020) <arXiv:2003.04314>. Some general use functions for Hawkes processes are also included: simulation of (in)homogeneous Hawkes process, maximum likelihood estimation, residual analysis, etc.
