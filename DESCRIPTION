Description: This package estimating Hawkes processes when count data are only observed in discrete time, using a spectral approach derived from the Bartlett spectrum. Some general use functions for Hawkes processes are also included: simulation of (in)homogeneous Hawkes process, maximum likelihood estimation, residual analysis, etc.
