abstract = {In recent years methods of data analysis for point processes have received some attention, for example, by Cox & Lewis (1966) and Lewis (1964). In particular Bartlett (1963a,b) has introduced methods of analysis based on the point spectrum. Theoretical models are relatively sparse. In this paper the theoretical properties of a class of processes with particu- lar reference to the point spectrum or corresponding covariance density functions are discussed. A particular result is a self-exciting process with the same second-order properties as a certain doubly stochastic process. These are not distinguishable by methods of data analysis based on these properties},

@article{Cheysson2020,
abstract = {This paper focuses on the time series generated by the event counts of stationary Hawkes processes. When the exact locations of points are not observed, but only counts over time intervals of fixed size, existing methods of estimation are not applicable. We first establish a strong mixing condition with polynomial decay rate for Hawkes processes, from their Poisson cluster structure. This allows us to propose a spectral approach to the estimation of Hawkes processes, based on Whittle's method, which provides consistent and asymptotically normal estimates under common regularity conditions on their reproduction kernels. Simulated datasets and a case-study illustrate the performances of the estimation, notably of the Hawkes reproduction mean and kernel when time intervals are relatively large.},

@book{Daley2003,
abstract = {The long-awaited Volume II of the second edition of Daley and Vere-Jones' now classic book on point processes has appeared exactly 20 years after the first edition was published. It lives up to the very high standards of both the first edition [D. J. Daley and D. Vere-Jones, An introduction to the theory of point processes, Springer, New York, 1988; MR0950166 (90e:60060)] and Volume I of the second [D. J. Daley and D. Vere-Jones, An introduction to the theory of point processes. Vol. I, Second edition, Springer, New York, 2003; MR1950431 (2004c:60001)]. As stated by the authors, the second volume focuses on the structure and general theory of point processes, with the more elementary theory appearing in the first volume (Chapters 1--8). Volume II (Chapters 9--15) contains most of the material that appeared in Chapters 7--14 of the first edition, as well as a significant number of new topics. Chapter 9 presents a detailed treatment of the general theory of random measures and point processes, a topic touched on only briefly in Volume I. This is followed by Chapter 10, on special classes such as completely random measures and infinitely divisible point processes, which also includes new material on Markov properties of point processes on general metric spaces. Convergence concepts are introduced in Chapter 11. Stationary point processes and random measures are the subject of Chapter 12, with new material on long-range dependence and self-similarity. Chapter 13 is devoted to Palm theory and includes a new section on fractal dimensions. The martingale approach to marked point processes on {$\$Bbb R_+} is exploited in Chapter 14, on so-called ``evolutionary'' processes---i.e., processes that evolve in time. Finally, Chapter 15 focuses on particular properties of spatial and space-time point processes. As was the case with the first edition, each topic is carefully motivated and an extensive literature review is provided. Heuristic explanations accompany rigorous proofs, and numerous examples and exercises (without solutions) are given. While the more basic material in Volume I is more widely accessible, Volume II will be of particular use to the specialist with a good background in probability, measure theory, and topology. In his review of the first edition of this book [op. cit.; MR0950166 (90e:60060)], Alan Karr predicted that it was ``likely to become the reference on point process theory''. His prediction was correct; both volumes of the second edition belong on the shelf of any modern probability theorist.},

abstract = {A new goodness-of-fit test for time series models is proposed. The test statistic is based on the distance between a kernel estimator of the ratio between the true and the hypothesized spectral density and the expected value of the estimator under the null. It provides a quantification of how well a parametric spectral density model fits the sample spectral density (periodogram). The asymptotic distribution of the statistic proposed is derived and its power properties are discussed. To improve upon the large sample (Gaussian) approximation of the distribution of the test statistic under the null, a bootstrap procedure is presented and justified theoretically. The finite sample performance of the test is investigated through a simulation experiment and applications to real data sets are given.},

abstract = {Rcpp is the glue that binds the power and versatility of R with the speed and efficiency of C++. With Rcpp, the transfer of data between R and C++ is nearly seamless, and high-performance statistical computing is finally accessible to most R users. Rcpp should be part of every statistician's toolbox. -- Michael Braun, MIT Sloan School of Management "Seamless R and C++ integration with Rcpp" is simply a wonderful book. For anyone who uses C/C++ and R, it is an indispensable resource. The writing is outstanding. A huge bonus is the section on applications. This section covers the matrix packages Armadillo and Eigen and the GNU Scientific Library as well as RInside which enables you to use R inside C++. These applications are what most of us need to know to really do scientific programming with R and C++. I love this book. -- Robert McCulloch, University of Chicago Booth School of Business Rcpp is now considered an essential package for anybody doing serious computational research using R. Dirk's book is an excellent companion and takes the reader from a gentle introduction to more advanced applications via numerous examples and efficiency enhancing gems. The book is packed with all you might have ever wanted to know about Rcpp, its cousins (RcppArmadillo, RcppEigen .etc.), modules, package development and sugar. Overall, this book is a must-have on your shelf. -- Sanjog Misra, UCLA Anderson School of Management The Rcpp package represents a major leap forward for scientific computations with R. With very few lines of C++ code, one has R's data structures readily at hand for further computations in C++. Hence, high-level numerical programming can be made in C++ almost as easily as in R, but often with a substantial speed gain. Dirk is a crucial person in these developments, and his book takes the reader from the first fragile steps on to using the full Rcpp machinery. A very recommended book! -- S{\o}ren H{\o}jsgaard, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Aalborg University, Denmark "Seamless R and C ++ Integration with Rcpp" provides the first comprehensive introduction to Rcpp. Rcpp has become the most widely-used language extension for R, and is deployed by over one-hundred different CRAN and BioConductor packages. Rcpp permits users to pass scalars, vectors, matrices, list or entire R objects back and forth between R and C++ with ease. This brings the depth of the R analysis framework together with the power, speed, and efficiency of C++. Dirk Eddelbuettel has been a contributor to CRAN for over a decade and maintains around twenty packages. He is the Debian/Ubuntu maintainer for R and other quantitative software, edits the CRAN Task Views for Finance and High-Performance Computing, is a co-founder of the annual R/Finance conference, and an editor of the Journal of Statistical Software. He holds a Ph.D. in Mathematical Economics from EHESS (Paris), and works in Chicago as a Senior Quantitative Analyst.},
