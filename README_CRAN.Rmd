In this package, we implement a spectral approach to the parametric estimation of Hawkes processes from binned observations.

## Installation

You can install the released version of hawkesbow from [GitHub](https://github.com/fcheysson/hawkesbow) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("fcheysson/hawkesbow")
```

## The Hawkes process

Hawkes processes form a family of models for point processes for which the occurrence of an event temporarily increases the probability of future events occurring [@Hawkes1971a].
Formally, a Hawkes process $N$ on $\mathbb R$ can be defined from its conditional intensity $\lambda(\cdot)$ :
\begin{align*}
\lambda(t) &= \eta + \int_{-\infty}^t h(t-u) N(\mathrm du)
&= \eta + \sum_{T_i < t} h(t - T_i),
\end{align*}
where the variables $T_i$ denote the arrival times of the process, the *immigration intensity* $\eta$ is a positive constant, and the *reproduction function* $h: \mathbb R_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb R_{\ge 0}$ is a measurable function.
Alternatively, the Hawkes process can be constructed as a poissonian cluster process [@Hawkes1974].
The process consists of a flow of *immigrants*, the cluster centres, arriving according to a homogeneous Poisson process of intensity $\eta$. 
Then, an immigrant arriving at time $T_i$ generates *children* according to an inhomogeneous Poisson process of intensity $h(\cdot - T_i)$. 
These in turn independently generate children according to the same process, and so on *ad infinitum*.
The processes consisting of an immigrant and all its descendants are therefore branching processes, and are independent of each other.
Finally, the process resulting from the superposition of all these branching processes is a Hawkes process of conditional intensity $\lambda(\cdot)$ (see the following figure of a realisation of an exponential Hawkes process with $\\eta = 1$, $h(t) = e^{-2t}$).

## Usage



## Reproduction kernels

Fourier transform:
$$\widetilde {h^\ast}(\omega) = \int_\mathbb R \exp(-i\omega t) h(t) \mathrm dt$$

### The exponential kernel

$$h^\ast(t) = \beta e^{-\beta t} 1_{\{t > 0\}}$$

Fourier transform
$$\widetilde {h^\ast}(\omega) = \beta \frac{1}{\beta + i\omega} = \beta \frac{\beta - i \omega}{\beta^2 + \omega^2}$$

The exponential kernel can be specified with the string "Exponential"

Both mle and whittle methods are available for exponential kernels.

### The Gaussian kernel

$$h^\ast(t) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt(2\pi)}\exp\left(-\frac{(t-\nu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$

Fourier transform
$$\widetilde {h^\ast}(\omega) = \exp\left(-\frac{\sigma^2\omega^2}{2}-i\nu\omega\right)$$

The gaussian kernel can be specified with the string "Gaussian"

Only whittle method is available for gaussian kernels.

### The Pareto kernels

$$h_\theta^\ast(t) = \theta a^\theta t^{-\theta - 1} 1_{\{t > a\}}$$

Fourier transform
$$\widetilde{h_\theta^\ast}(\omega) = \theta a^\theta E_{\theta + 1} (i\omega) $$
where
$$E_{\theta+1}(i\omega) = \int_a^{+\infty} \frac{\exp(-i\omega t)}{t^{\theta+1}} \mathrm dt$$

Only Pareto kernels with $\theta = 1$, $2$, and $3$ have been implemented and can specified with the strngs "Pareto1", "Pareto2" and "Pareto3" respectively.

Only whittle method is available for Pareto kernels.

### Power law kernel

$$h^\ast(t) = \theta a^\theta (t+a)^{-\theta-1} 1_{\{\theta > 0 \}}$$

Fourier transform
$$\widetilde{h_\theta^\ast}(\omega) = \theta a^\theta \exp(i\omega a)E_{\theta + 1} (i\omega) $$

The power law kernel can be specified with the string "PowerLaw"

Both mle and whittle methods are available for power law kernels.
